## Nodejs Ecommerce Store
An amazon clone ecommerce store built in NodeJS utilizing Express, Stripe Payment, MongoDB, Elastic Search, Faker API just to mention a few. Developed with the latest cutting edge industry standard technologies, eTswana stores allows a shopper to browse through the online store and buy products using a credit card. eTswana stores supports social sign up and sign in using Facebook.

### Live Demo
View the live demo as hosted on Heroku at 
https://etswana.herokuapp.com/
 (application may take few seconds to open)

### Requirements
```
1. Internet connection
2. NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/)
3. VS Code (optional: I use WebStorm)
4. MongoDB (you can use www.mlab.com or Docker alternative)
5. Elastic Search (https://www.elastic.co/ or Docker alternative):
    Download version 1.7.5 others are not compatable
6. Stripe account
```
### Instructions
Open the project in VS Code, and navigate to config folder. Open the config.js in the editor:

Add mongodb URL:
```
 database: '<mongo_db_url>' e.g. mongodb://localhost/test
```
 Provide a secret key:
 ```
 secretKey: "<add_secret_key>" - e.g. LKSJ&%$#XFE
 ```
Using Facebook developer site, create a Facebook app and retrieve the following:
```
clientID: process.env.FACEBOOK_ID || '<facebook_id>'

clientSecret: process.env.FACEBOOK_SECRET || '<facebook_secret_key>'
```
Create an account with Stripe Payment (https://stripe.com/)
```
Open routes/main.js to add the 'sk_test_SAF...' 
number retrieved from Stripe.com
```
 
## Running the application

 Now that we are set. Open project in terminal, and:
 ```
 npm install (this will install all dependencies)
 ```
 
 Once all dependencies are installed
 ```
 npm start 
 ```
 
 aggg!! Project does not run
 ```
 * Make sure Elasticsearch is running (version 1.7.5).
 * If using MongoDB locally, make sure it is running as well.
 ```
 alternatively if you have Docker and Docker compose installed then simply docker-compose up. This will install and run MongoD and ElasticSearch.
 
## Testing 
 
 Add testing data to the application by loading API data from Faker API. To do this,
 open ``http://localhost:3000/api/<name-of-category-added>``. Do this for all categories. I will automate this functionality with Cypress UI automation tool.
 
 ``started on automating this``
 
 To run automated UI tests, run ```npm run test```
 
 The tests are written using the Cypress framework (https://www.cypress.io)
 
## Docker & Kubernetes

To create a Docker container for the application, ``docker build -t etswana:1.0.0 .``. Create the Docker image with ``docker run etswana:1.0.0``

WIP: add more instructions on setting up Docker and Kubernetes including monitoring.
 
## Whats Next

1. ~~REFACTOR! Clean code comments~~
2. ~~REFACTOR! Improved code readability~~
3. More functionality to the ecommerce 
4. Write a detailed tutorial - probably use a package to generate one
  from the code comments
